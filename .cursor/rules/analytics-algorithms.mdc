# Analytics Algorithms

## Core Analytics Components

### 1. Win Rate Analysis Engine (Importance: 95)

Calculates weighted win probabilities based on:

- Historical performance by agency
- Project magnitude range ($0-10M, $10-25M, $25-75M, $75M+)
- Set-aside category matching
- Geographic region success rates

**Implementation**: Rolling 90-day window with 5-sample minimum threshold

```typescript
// Key calculation
winRate = successfulBids / totalBids (last 90 days)
weightedWinRate = winRate * magnitudeWeight * regionWeight
```

### 2. What-If Analysis System (Importance: 90)

Simulates pipeline outcomes with adjustable parameters:

- Win rate modifications (±20% range)
- Award timing shifts
- Value distribution changes
- Geographic focus adjustments

**Key Files**:

- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/WhatIfDrawer.tsx`
- `frontend/src/utils/calculations/pipeline-metrics.ts`

### 3. Capacity Utilization Modeling (Importance: 85)

Tracks resource allocation across pipeline stages:

```typescript
// Capacity calculation
capacityUtilization = (activeProjectValue / baseCapacity) * 100
// baseCapacity = $30M default

// Warning thresholds
WARNING_THRESHOLD = 80%  // Yellow alert
CRITICAL_THRESHOLD = 100% // Red alert
```

### 4. Pipeline Velocity Calculator (Importance: 85)

Measures progression speed through stages:

- Stage transition durations
- Bottleneck identification
- Stalled project detection (>1.5x average duration)
- Completion rate trending

### 5. Annual Target Metrics (Importance: 80)

```typescript
// Run rate calculation
runRate = ytdAwards / monthsElapsed;
projectedAnnual = runRate * 12;

// Required volume
requiredVolume = (annualTarget - ytdAwards) / avgProjectValue;
```

## Key Business Rules

| Rule                     | Threshold         | Action                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Minimum win rate samples | 5 bids            | Use default 25% if insufficient |
| Capacity warning         | 80%               | Yellow indicator                |
| Capacity critical        | 100%              | Red indicator, block new bids   |
| Stalled detection        | 1.5x avg duration | Flag for review                 |
| Rolling window           | 90 days           | Win rate calculation period     |

## Stage Duration Thresholds

| Stage          | Expected Duration | Stall Threshold |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Proposal       | 45 days           | 68 days         |
| Negotiation    | 30 days           | 45 days         |
| Award Decision | 15 days           | 23 days         |
