## Core Metrics System

### Pipeline Value Calculator

**Weighted Pipeline Value Formula**:

```typescript
weightedValue = Σ(projectValue × stageWinProbability)

// Stage probabilities
const STAGE_PROBABILITIES = {
  'lead': 0.10,
  'proposal': 0.25,
  'negotiation': 0.50,
  'verbal_award': 0.75,
  'awarded': 1.00,
  'lost': 0.00
};
```

**Key File**: `frontend/src/services/metrics/metrics.service.ts`

### Construction KPI Framework

| KPI                  | Formula                      | Update Trigger        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Total Pipeline       | Σ(all active project values) | Project add/update    |
| Weighted Pipeline    | Σ(value × probability)       | Stage change          |
| Win Rate             | wins / (wins + losses)       | Award/loss recorded   |
| Capacity Utilization | active value / $30M          | Project status change |
| Stage Velocity       | projects moved / time        | Stage transition      |

### Financial Projection Engine

```typescript
// Annual projection
const projectedAnnual = (ytdAwards / monthsElapsed) * 12;

// Required volume to hit target
const requiredProjects = Math.ceil(
  (annualTarget - ytdAwards) / averageProjectValue
);

// Months remaining calculation
const monthsRemaining = 12 - currentMonth;
const requiredMonthlyPace = (annualTarget - ytdAwards) / monthsRemaining;
```

### Stage Performance Analytics

| Stage          | Avg Duration | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Lead           | 14 days      | 21 days           | 28 days            |
| Proposal       | 45 days      | 60 days           | 90 days            |
| Negotiation    | 30 days      | 45 days           | 60 days            |
| Award Decision | 15 days      | 21 days           | 30 days            |

**Stalled Detection**:

```typescript
const isStalled = (project) => {
  const daysInStage = daysSince(project.stageEntryDate);
  const threshold = STAGE_THRESHOLDS[project.stage] * 1.5;
  return daysInStage > threshold;
};
```

## Key Formulas Reference

### Weighted Pipeline Value

```
Weighted Value = Σ(Project Value × Stage Win Probability)
```

### Stage Velocity

```
Velocity = Projects Moved to Next Stage / Time Period (days)
```

### Resource Utilization

```
Utilization = (Active Project Value / Max Capacity) × 100
Max Capacity = $30,000,000 (default)
```

### Geographic Distribution Score

```
Distribution = Σ(Regional Project Count × Market Weight)
```

### Capacity Requirement

```
Required Capacity = Σ(Project Value × Win Probability × Resource Factor)
Resource Factor varies by stage (0.1 to 1.0)
```

## Threshold Rules

| Metric            | Green       | Yellow      | Red         |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Capacity          | < 80%       | 80-100%     | > 100%      |
| Stage Duration    | < avg       | avg to 1.5x | > 1.5x      |
| Win Rate          | > 30%       | 20-30%      | < 20%       |
| Pipeline Coverage | > 3x target | 2-3x target | < 2x target |
