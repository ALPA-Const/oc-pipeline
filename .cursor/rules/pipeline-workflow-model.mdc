# Pipeline Workflow Model

## Four-Phase Construction Lifecycle

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌───────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│ OPPORTUNITY │ → │ PRECONSTRUCTION │ → │ EXECUTION │ → │ CLOSEOUT │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └───────────┘    └──────────┘
```

## Phase 1: Opportunity Pipeline

### Stages

1. **Lead Generation** - Initial project identification
2. **Proposal Development** - Bid preparation
3. **Client Submission** - Formal proposal submitted
4. **Negotiation** - Terms discussion
5. **Award Decision** - Won or Lost

### Validation Requirements

- Win probability calculation required
- Resource capacity check before bid
- Set-aside classification verified
- Geographic eligibility confirmed

### Win Probability by Stage

| Stage        | Default Probability |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Lead         | 10%                 |
| Proposal     | 25%                 |
| Negotiation  | 50%                 |
| Verbal Award | 75%                 |
| Awarded      | 100%                |

## Phase 2: Preconstruction Pipeline

### Stages

1. **Planning & Scope** - Project definition
2. **Design Development** - Technical specifications
3. **Value Engineering** - Cost optimization
4. **Permit Applications** - Regulatory approvals
5. **Trade Bidding** - Subcontractor selection
6. **GMP Development** - Guaranteed Maximum Price

### Validation Requirements

- Document completeness check
- Agency approvals obtained
- Trade coverage verified (all scopes covered)
- Budget alignment confirmed

## Phase 3: Execution Pipeline

### Stages

1. **Mobilization** - Site setup
2. **Site Prep** - Ground work
3. **Foundation** - Structural base
4. **Structure** - Building frame
5. **MEP Rough-in** - Mechanical/Electrical/Plumbing
6. **Interior/Exterior** - Finishes
7. **Systems Testing** - Commissioning
8. **Punch List** - Deficiency resolution
9. **Substantial Completion** - Ready for occupancy

### Validation Requirements

- Schedule compliance tracking
- Quality metrics maintained
- Safety requirements met
- Change order documentation

## Phase 4: Closeout Pipeline

### Stages

1. **Final Inspections** - Authority sign-offs
2. **Documentation Package** - As-builts, O&M manuals
3. **Warranties/Guarantees** - Coverage activation
4. **Financial Reconciliation** - Final accounting
5. **Project Archive** - Records retention

### Validation Requirements

- All inspections passed
- Documentation complete
- Warranty coverage active
- Final payment received

## Stage Transition Rules

### General Rules

- Forward-only progression between major phases
- Bi-directional movement allowed within phase stages
- Stage skipping prohibited (except expedited projects)

### Approval Requirements by Value

| Project Value | Approval Level      |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| < $25M        | Project Manager     |
| $25M - $75M   | Operations Director |
| > $75M        | Executive Committee |

## Health Status Calculations

| Status    | Criteria                                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Green  | Within 80% of stage duration baseline           |
| 🟡 Yellow | 81-120% of baseline duration                    |
| 🔴 Red    | >120% of baseline OR missing critical documents |

## Value Calculations by Phase

```typescript
const calculatePhaseValue = (project) => {
  switch (project.phase) {
    case "opportunity":
      return project.contractValue * project.winProbability;
    case "preconstruction":
      return project.gmpValue * 0.95;
    case "execution":
      return project.earnedValue;
    case "closeout":
      return project.retainageValue;
  }
};
```

## Set-Aside Classifications

| Code        | Description                  | Requirements      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 8(a)        | Small Disadvantaged Business | SBA certification |
| SDVOSB      | Service-Disabled Veteran     | VA verification   |
| HUBZone     | Historically Underutilized   | SBA certification |
| WOSB        | Women-Owned Small Business   | SBA certification |
| Full & Open | No restrictions              | None              |
