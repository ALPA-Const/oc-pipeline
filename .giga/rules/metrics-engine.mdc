# metrics-engine

Core Metrics Components:

1. Pipeline Value Analytics (Importance: 95)
- Weighted pipeline calculations considering win probability
- Stage-based value aggregation with risk adjustments
- Project stalling detection with velocity thresholds
- Multi-dimensional KPIs tracking:
  - Win rate by project type/size
  - Stage conversion ratios 
  - Cycle time metrics
  - Capacity utilization

2. Financial Projections Engine (Importance: 90)
- Fiscal year-end modeling with:
  - Rolling 90-day win rate analysis
  - Award size probability distributions
  - Monthly award pace calculations
  - What-if scenario modeling
- Capacity constraint analysis against $30M baseline

3. Geographic Distribution Analytics (Importance: 85)
- Regional concentration metrics
- Territory-based performance tracking
- State-level project density analysis
- Set-aside category distribution mapping

Key Business Calculations:
- Pipeline velocity = (Projects Won / Total Projects) * (Avg Days to Win)
- Weighted Pipeline Value = Σ(Project Value * Win Probability * Stage Weight)
- Monthly Award Pace = (90-day Awards / 3) * (Months Remaining)
- Capacity Utilization = (Active Project Value / $30M Baseline) * 100

Threshold Rules:
- Critical capacity warning at 100% utilization
- High risk alert at 80% capacity
- Stalled project flag after 30 days in stage
- Minimum 5 samples for win rate calculation

# metrics-engine

Core Metrics Components:

1. Pipeline Value Calculator
Importance Score: 95
- Weighted value calculations incorporating:
  * Base project value
  * Win probability multiplier
  * Stage-specific confidence factors
  * Set-aside program adjustments
  * Joint venture share calculations

2. Performance Analytics Engine
Importance Score: 90
- Pipeline velocity metrics:
  * Award pace vs fiscal year targets
  * Stage-specific conversion rates 
  * Bottleneck detection using duration variance
  * Stalled project identification
  * Capacity utilization warnings (80%/100% thresholds)

3. Financial Projection System
Importance Score: 85
- Automated projections based on:
  * 90-day rolling window analysis
  * Stage-weighted pipeline values
  * Award probability adjustments
  * Required volume calculations
  * Run rate vs annual target comparisons

4. Geographic Distribution Analytics
Importance Score: 80
- Multi-dimensional project analysis:
  * State-level aggregation
  * Project type distribution
  * Set-aside program tracking
  * Value-weighted heat mapping
  * Regional capacity monitoring

Key Formulas:
```
Weighted Pipeline Value = Σ(Project Value × Win Probability × Stage Factor)
Stage Velocity = (Projects Completed / Time Period) × Stage Multiplier
Capacity Utilization = (Active Project Value / Base Capacity) × 100
Required Volume = (Annual Target - YTD Awards) / Average Project Value
```
