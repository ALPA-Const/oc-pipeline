Core Metrics Components:

1. Pipeline Value Calculator
Importance Score: 95
- Weighted value calculations incorporating:
  * Base project value
  * Win probability multiplier
  * Stage-specific confidence factors
  * Set-aside program adjustments
  * Joint venture share calculations

2. Performance Analytics Engine
Importance Score: 90
- Pipeline velocity metrics:
  * Award pace vs fiscal year targets
  * Stage-specific conversion rates 
  * Bottleneck detection using duration variance
  * Stalled project identification
  * Capacity utilization warnings (80%/100% thresholds)

3. Financial Projection System
Importance Score: 85
- Automated projections based on:
  * 90-day rolling window analysis
  * Stage-weighted pipeline values
  * Award probability adjustments
  * Required volume calculations
  * Run rate vs annual target comparisons

4. Geographic Distribution Analytics
Importance Score: 80
- Multi-dimensional project analysis:
  * State-level aggregation
  * Project type distribution
  * Set-aside program tracking
  * Value-weighted heat mapping
  * Regional capacity monitoring

Key Formulas:
```
Weighted Pipeline Value = Σ(Project Value × Win Probability × Stage Factor)
Stage Velocity = (Projects Completed / Time Period) × Stage Multiplier
Capacity Utilization = (Active Project Value / Base Capacity) × 100
Required Volume = (Annual Target - YTD Awards) / Average Project Value
```
