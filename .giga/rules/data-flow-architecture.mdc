# data-flow-architecture

The data flow architecture centers around a bidirectional pipeline management system with real-time updates across components:

## Core Data Flows

1. Dashboard Analytics Stream
- BiddingAnalyticsPanel → Pipeline Store → WhatIfDrawer
- Real-time capacity threshold monitoring (80%, 100%)
- Pipeline velocity metrics propagation
- Interactive simulation parameter updates

2. Pipeline Stage Management Flow
- KanbanBoard → Pipeline Store → Project Cards
- Stage transition validation checks
- Aggregate metrics calculation per stage
- Project health status propagation
- Stalled project detection notifications

3. Geographic Distribution Channel
- BarDistributionChart → MapContext → Regional Analytics
- Set-aside pattern distribution
- Regional concentration metrics
- State-level aggregation updates

## State Management Patterns

1. Dashboard Context
- Centralized filter state
- KPI synchronization across views
- Audit logging for metric changes

2. Pipeline Store
- Stage-based project organization
- Health status calculations
- Value aggregation by phase
- Transition validation rules

## Component Interaction Flows

1. Annual Target Updates
- Target tracking propagation
- Progress visualization updates
- Status indicator thresholds
- Completion percentage calculation

2. Project Data Validation
- Schema validation events
- Field-level warning system
- Data quality propagation
- Custom formatting rules

The architecture emphasizes real-time synchronization between pipeline components while maintaining strict validation and business rule enforcement at each data flow junction.
