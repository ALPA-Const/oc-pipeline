Core Data Flow Components

1. Pipeline State Management
Path: src/stores/pipeline.ts
Importance Score: 90/100
- Centralized state store for construction project pipeline data
- Real-time project stage transitions with validation
- Bidirectional sync between Kanban board and analytics panels
- Push-based updates for critical pipeline metrics

2. Metrics Data Processing
Path: src/services/metrics/metrics.service.ts 
Importance Score: 85/100
- Stream processing for construction KPI calculations
- Event-driven updates of win rate probabilities
- Pub/sub system for geographic distribution analysis
- Real-time capacity utilization monitoring

3. Dashboard Data Integration
Path: src/components/dashboard/*
Importance Score: 80/100
- Observer pattern for KPI card updates
- Reactive data binding for annual target tracking
- Bidirectional sync between what-if analysis and pipeline state
- Push notifications for critical threshold alerts

Data Flow Patterns:

1. Pipeline Updates
- Project cards emit stage transition events
- Pipeline store validates and processes transitions
- Analytics engine recalculates affected metrics
- Dashboard components receive push updates

2. Metric Calculations 
- Raw project data streams through metrics service
- Transformed metrics published to subscribers
- Dashboard components react to metric updates
- Threshold violations trigger alerts

3. Geographic Distribution
- Project location changes trigger regional recalculation
- Updated distribution pushed to map components
- Territory analysis refreshed on data changes
- Real-time sync between map and metrics views

The architecture implements a reactive data flow optimized for construction project pipeline management, with emphasis on real-time updates and bi-directional synchronization between components.

# data-flow-architecture

Core Data Flow Patterns:

1. Pipeline State Management
- Central pipeline store manages project stage transitions
- Real-time stage capacity monitoring with threshold alerts (>80%)
- Bi-directional sync between Kanban board and analytics panels
- Weighted value calculations propagate on stage changes

2. Analytics Data Flow
Components:
- BiddingAnalyticsPanel → WhatIfDrawer
- KanbanBoard → PipelineMetrics
- AnnualTargetCard → BiddingProjectsTable

Flow patterns:
- Pipeline velocity metrics update on stage transitions
- Capacity forecasts recalculate on project value changes 
- Win probability impacts cascade to annual projections
- Geographic distribution updates trigger heat map refreshes

3. Project Health Monitoring
- Stage duration monitoring feeds stalled project detection
- Health status calculations trigger warning propagation
- Automated urgency level updates based on deadline proximity
- Real-time capacity utilization warnings (>100% threshold)

4. Data Synchronization
- Geographic filters sync across map and table views
- Project distribution metrics update bidding analytics
- Stage capacity limits enforce project movement rules
- Set-aside compliance status propagates to relevant views

Key Integration Points:
```
KanbanBoard -> PipelineMetrics -> WhatIfDrawer
     ↓              ↓                ↓
BiddingTable <- TargetCard <- AnalyticsPanel
```

State Management:
- MapFilterContext maintains geographic/stage filters
- PipelineContext handles stage transitions/validation
- MetricsContext manages KPI calculations/updates
- ProjectContext tracks individual project states

# data-flow-architecture

Core Data Flow Patterns:

1. Pipeline State Management
- Centralized PipelineStore manages pipeline stage data
- Real-time updates propagate through WebSocket connections
- Stage transitions trigger cascading updates to dependent metrics
- Component subscriptions handle weighted value recalculations

2. KPI Update Flow
- KPI cards subscribe to metrics service events
- Metric updates flow through dedicated metrics context
- Changes in project status trigger recalculation of:
  - Pipeline velocity
  - Win rate projections 
  - Capacity utilization
  - Geographic distributions

3. What-If Analysis Data Flow
- Simulation engine maintains isolated state copy
- Changes propagate through dedicated analysis context
- Results flow to visualization components without affecting main state
- Reset mechanism restores baseline pipeline metrics

4. Project Distribution Updates
- Geographic context maintains aggregated project data
- Updates trigger region-specific recalculations
- State-level metrics flow to distribution visualizations
- Binning logic updates project category distributions

5. Target Tracking Flow
- Annual targets context broadcasts goal updates
- Progress calculations flow through dedicated service
- Real-time status determinations update tracking components
- Required project counts recalculate on value changes

6. Kanban Stage Management
- Board subscribes to pipeline stage transitions
- Capacity tracking updates flow through stage context
- Aging detection triggers stall notifications
- Value calculations update on project movements
