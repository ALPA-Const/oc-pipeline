Core Analytics Components:

1. Win Rate Calculator (Importance: 90)
- Implements 90-day rolling window calculations for bid success rates
- Adjusts win probabilities based on historical performance by project type
- Computes confidence intervals for projected win rates
- Factors in project size and geographic distribution

2. Capacity Utilization Engine (Importance: 85) 
- Models resource allocation across concurrent projects
- Projects capacity limits based on active and pending bids
- Triggers warnings at 80% and 100% thresholds
- Accounts for project type-specific resource requirements

3. What-If Analysis System (Importance: 90)
- Simulates fiscal year-end scenarios with adjustable parameters:
  - Win rate variations
  - Award size modifications
  - Timeline shifts
  - Resource allocation changes
- Recalculates all dependent KPIs in real-time

4. Pipeline Velocity Calculator (Importance: 85)
- Measures stage-to-stage transition speeds
- Identifies bottlenecks through variance analysis
- Calculates weighted averages based on project value
- Requires minimum 5 awarded projects for validation

5. Geographic Distribution Analysis (Importance: 80)
- Processes regional concentration of projects
- Analyzes set-aside distribution patterns
- Calculates territorial saturation metrics
- Maps project density against market opportunities

Implementation Details:
- 90-day rolling windows for trend analysis
- Monthly pace projections with seasonal adjustments
- Fiscal year projections incorporating historical patterns
- Weighted pipeline values based on stage progression
