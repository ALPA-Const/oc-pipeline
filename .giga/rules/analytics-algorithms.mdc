Core Analytics Components:

1. Win Rate Calculation Engine
Path: src/services/metrics/win-rate.service.ts
- Rolling 90-day window calculations for bid success rates
- Weighted win probability scoring based on project attributes
- Sector-specific success rate normalization
- Historical trend analysis with seasonal adjustments
Importance Score: 90

2. Pipeline Velocity Analytics 
Path: src/services/metrics/velocity.service.ts
- Stage transition time calculations with bottleneck detection
- Cycle time analysis for bid-to-award process
- Stage-specific duration modeling
- Stall detection with variance thresholds
Importance Score: 85

3. Capacity Utilization Modeling
Path: src/utils/calculations/capacity.ts
- Resource allocation forecasting across project stages
- Utilization rate calculations with FTE modeling
- Scenario-based capacity planning algorithms
- Geographic resource distribution analysis
Importance Score: 85

4. What-If Analysis Engine
Path: src/services/metrics/simulation.ts
- Win rate impact simulations on pipeline value
- Award size scenario modeling
- Resource requirement projections
- Financial outcome forecasting
Importance Score: 80

Key Algorithms:
- Weighted pipeline value = Σ(Project Value × Stage Weight × Win Probability)
- Stage Velocity = (Projects Completed / Time Period) × Stage Factor
- Resource Utilization = (Allocated Hours / Available Hours) × Efficiency Factor
- Win Rate Trend = (90-day Success Count / Total Bids) + Seasonal Adjustment

The system implements construction-specific analytics focused on bid management, resource planning, and pipeline optimization with industry-standard calculations and forecasting models.
