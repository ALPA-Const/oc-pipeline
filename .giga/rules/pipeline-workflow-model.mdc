Pipeline Stage Categories:

1. Opportunity Pipeline
- Lead Generation → Initial Assessment
- Proposal Development → RFP Response 
- Negotiation → Contract Review
- Final Award/Loss Decision

2. Preconstruction Pipeline
- Planning Phase → Scope Definition
- Design Development → Drawing Review
- Permitting → Regulatory Approval
- Construction Readiness → Site Prep

3. Execution Pipeline  
- Mobilization → Resource Deployment
- Active Construction → Progress Tracking
- Punch List → Deficiency Resolution
- Substantial Completion → Owner Acceptance

4. Closeout Pipeline
- Final Inspection → Authority Review
- Documentation → Record Assembly
- Warranty Period → Support Window
- Project Completion → Archive

Stage Transition Rules:
- Opportunity → Preconstruction requires signed contract
- Preconstruction → Execution requires permits and bonding
- Execution → Closeout requires owner acceptance
- Each stage has specific duration thresholds and validation criteria

Health Indicators:
- Stalled: >30 days in stage without progress
- At Risk: Approaching stage duration threshold
- On Track: Within expected timeframes
- Ahead: Below average duration metrics

Stage-Specific Metrics:
- Value weighted by stage progression
- Win probability calculations
- Capacity utilization tracking
- Geographic distribution analysis
- Bottleneck identification
- Cycle time measurements

Validation Requirements:
- Stage entry criteria verification
- Document completion checks
- Financial approval thresholds
- Resource availability confirmation
- Regulatory compliance validation
- Quality control signoffs
