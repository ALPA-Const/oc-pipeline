## Pipeline Stage Architecture

Four primary pipeline stages with defined transitions and validations:

1. Opportunity Pipeline
- Lead Generation → Proposal → Negotiation → Award/Lost
- Win probability calculations at each substage
- Required fields: bid amount, due date, competition analysis
- Automatic stalling detection after 30 days without progress

2. Preconstruction Pipeline  
- Planning → Design → Permitting → Ready
- Design document tracking
- Permit status validation
- Resource allocation requirements
- Stage-specific approvals needed for progression

3. Execution Pipeline
- Mobilization → Construction → Punch List → Substantial 
- Progress tracking against milestones
- Change order workflow integration
- Schedule variance monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking

4. Closeout Pipeline
- Final Inspection → Documentation → Warranty → Complete
- Inspection checklist validation
- Required documentation verification
- Warranty period tracking
- Final payment milestone tracking

## Stage Transition Rules

Stage Progression Requirements:
- Financial approval thresholds by stage
- Mandatory document attachments
- Role-based transition authorization
- Audit logging of all stage changes

## Key Validation Points

1. Opportunity Stage
- Bid package completeness check
- Competition analysis requirements
- Win probability calculation
- Resource availability verification

2. Preconstruction Stage  
- Design document version control
- Permit status verification
- Budget approval requirements
- Schedule baseline validation

3. Execution Stage
- Progress payment validation
- Change order approval workflow
- Schedule update requirements
- Resource allocation checks

4. Closeout Stage
- Punch list completion verification
- Warranty documentation requirements
- Final payment conditions
- Project archive requirements

## Pipeline Health Monitoring

Stalled Project Detection:
- Stage-specific duration thresholds
- Automated notifications for stalled projects
- Escalation workflows for overdue stages
- Historical duration analysis

Stage Health Indicators:
- Value-weighted stage metrics
- Conversion rate tracking
- Cycle time monitoring
- Bottleneck identification
