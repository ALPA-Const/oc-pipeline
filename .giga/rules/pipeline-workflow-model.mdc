Pipeline Stage Model:

1. Primary Pipeline Stages
Importance Score: 90
- Opportunity Phase
  - Lead Generation
  - Proposal Development 
  - Negotiation
  - Award/Lost Decision
- Preconstruction Phase
  - Project Planning
  - Design Review
  - Permitting
  - Resource Ready
- Execution Phase
  - Site Mobilization
  - Active Construction
  - Punch List Review
  - Substantial Completion
- Closeout Phase
  - Final Inspection
  - Documentation
  - Warranty Period
  - Project Complete

2. Stage Transition Rules
Importance Score: 85
- Forward-only progression between major phases
- Bi-directional movement allowed within phase stages
- Required approvals per transition:
  - Financial threshold reviews
  - Documentation completeness
  - Stakeholder sign-offs
  - Resource availability verification

3. Stage Validation Requirements
Importance Score: 80
- Opportunity Phase
  - Win probability calculation
  - Resource capacity check
  - Budget authorization
- Preconstruction Phase
  - Permit verification
  - Design approval status
  - Resource commitment
- Execution Phase
  - Schedule baseline
  - Budget controls
  - Quality metrics
- Closeout Phase
  - Inspection results
  - Warranty documentation
  - Final payment status

4. Pipeline Health Indicators
Importance Score: 75
- Stage duration thresholds
- Value concentration limits
- Stalled project detection
- Resource utilization targets
- Conversion rate monitoring

The model enforces strict construction industry workflows while maintaining flexibility for project-specific requirements. Stage progression is controlled through validation gates ensuring all business requirements are met before advancement.

Pipeline Stage Progression Framework
Importance Score: 90

Four distinct pipeline domains with controlled stage transitions:

1. Opportunity Pipeline
- Lead Generation → Project Identified → Initial Review
- Proposal Development → Client Submission → Negotiation 
- Award Decision (Won/Lost)
Validation: Win probability calculations, stalled detection at 1.5x avg duration

2. Preconstruction Pipeline  
- Planning & Scope → Design Development → Value Engineering
- Permit Applications → Trade Bidding → GMP Development
- Ready for Execution
Validation: Document completeness, agency approvals, trade coverage

3. Execution Pipeline
- Mobilization → Site Prep → Foundation
- Structure → MEP Rough-in → Interior/Exterior
- Systems Testing → Punch List → Substantial Completion
Validation: Schedule compliance, quality metrics, safety requirements

4. Closeout Pipeline
- Final Inspections → Agency Sign-offs
- Documentation Package → Warranties/Guarantees
- Financial Reconciliation → Project Archive
Validation: Documentation completeness, warranty coverage, financial closure

Stage Transition Rules:
- Forward-only progression between domains
- Stage skipping prohibited except for expedited projects
- Required approvals based on project value tiers:
  * <$25M: Project Manager approval
  * $25M-$75M: Operations Director approval
  * >$75M: Executive approval

Health Status Calculations:
- Green: Within 80% of stage duration baseline
- Yellow: 81-120% of baseline duration
- Red: >120% of baseline or missing critical documents

Value Calculations:
- Opportunity: Contract value × win probability
- Preconstruction: GMP value × 0.95
- Execution: Earned value metrics
- Closeout: Final contract value
